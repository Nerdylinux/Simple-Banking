# **Simple Banking System in Java**

This is a basic banking application implemented in Java. The project is currently at an early stage and serves as a foundation for the future inprovements.
It simulates simple banking operations using .txt files for data storage, with plans to enchance the system significantly over time.

## Features

1) Basic banking functionality
2) User account creation
3) Balance inquiry
4) Deposit and withdrawal transactions
5) Data stored in .txt files [though that's a drawback :)]

## Next Steps (i.e. Future Improvements)

The current version is very minimal but there are several improvements
that are planned ahead. Some of them are :-

### 1. Password System

Completed ! :)

### 2. Currency Verification System

Add a robust verification system for validating the currency and preventing
errors or frauds during transactions. This will ensure :-

1) Correct currency values are used by users
2) Prevention of invalid or malicious input

### 3. Database Integration

Replace the current .txt file system with a proper database for storing user data and transaction history.
Benfits of this change include :-

1) Enhanced performance
2) Better data organization
3) Scalability for larger datasets

## Project Vision

The ultimate goal is to transform this basic project into a full-fledged banking system with secure, efficient, and scalable features. This will involve gradual improvements in both functionality and security, including the use of modern database management systems, improved user interfaces, and a broader range of financial operations.
