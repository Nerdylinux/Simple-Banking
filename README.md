Simple Banking System in Java
This is a basic banking application implemented in Java. The project is currently at an early stage and serves as a foundation for future improvements. It simulates simple banking operations using .txt files for data storage, with plans to enhance the system significantly over time.

Features
Basic banking functionality
User account creation
Balance inquiry
Deposit and withdrawal transactions
Data stored in .txt files
Next Steps (Planned Improvements)
The current version of the project is minimal, but there are several exciting improvements planned for future versions:

Password System
Implement a secure password system to protect user accounts and transactions. This will include:

User authentication during login
Encryption for password storage
Currency Verification System
Add a robust verification system for validating the currency and preventing errors or fraud during transactions. This will ensure:

Correct currency values are used
Prevention of invalid or malicious input
Database Integration
Replace the current .txt file system with a proper database for storing user data and transaction history. Benefits of this change include:

Enhanced performance
Better data organization
Scalability for larger datasets
Project Vision
The ultimate goal is to transform this basic project into a full-fledged banking system with secure, efficient, and scalable features. This will involve gradual improvements in both functionality and security, including the use of modern database management systems, improved user interfaces, and a broader range of financial operations.
